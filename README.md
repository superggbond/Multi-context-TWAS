# Multi-context TWAS
An analytical pipeline for multi-context transcriptome-wide association studies

## 1. Introduction
This GitHub repository contains sample scripts that used for the analyses performed in the manuscript:

Zhang, H., Patrick, M. T., Sarkar, M. K., ... & Tsoi, L. C. (2025). Multi-cytokine based TWAS for seven inflammatory skin disorders identify candidate causal genes in keratinocytes.

We performed a multi-context marginal TWAS analyses on skin disorders. The following sections will go through the workflow of the main analysis step-by-step, using our multi-cytokine based TWAS as an example.

## 2. GReX modeling using BSLMM
